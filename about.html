      <h1>About Langcos</h1>
      <p class="lead" style="max-width:70ch;">
        Langcos was founded in December 2025 by Will Cerne, a PhD student in theoretical cosmology and early universe physics in Tokyo, Japan.

  <strong><em>“Langcos”</em> — the language of the cosmos — began as a promise I made to myself during my undergraduate years.</strong>
</p>

<p class="muted" style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
  As a physics student, I often found myself accepting powerful ideas without truly understanding them. 
  Why does the <strong>Principle of Stationary Action</strong> work so universally? 
  How can magnetism depend on velocity if the laws of physics are frame-independent? 
  Why does adding angular momentum reduce to finding irreducible representations of <em>SO(3)</em>? 
  Why do Taylor series converge to functions that aren’t polynomials?
</p>

<p class="muted" style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
  I learned how to solve the problems. I passed the exams. 
  <strong>But I knew there was a deeper layer of understanding that I hadn’t yet reached.</strong>
</p>

<p class="muted" style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
  It wasn’t until graduate school that many of these ideas finally clicked — 
  not just computationally, but structurally. I began to see how the pieces fit together. 
  I began to think more like a <strong>theoretical physicist</strong> rather than a student completing assignments.
</p>

<p class="muted" style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
  <strong>Langcos was created to bridge that gap.</strong>
</p>

<p class="muted" style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
  This project is dedicated to ambitious physics and mathematics students who want more than just exam solutions. 
  Langcos focuses on the <strong>structure behind calculations</strong>, 
  the <strong>logic behind physical principles</strong>, 
  and the <strong>habits of thought</strong> that turn coursework into real understanding.
</p>

<p class="muted" style="margin:0;">
  If you are preparing for graduate school, struggling to connect concepts across courses, 
  or simply want to think more clearly and rigorously about physics, 
  <strong>Langcos is built for you.</strong>
