              “Langcos”, meaning <em>language of the cosmos</em>, is a project I started to help undergraduates in physics and mathematics learn difficult topics faster—and with less frustration. Throughout my undergraduate,
              certain topics in the courses I took puzzled me. Why is the Stationary Action Principle true? Why is magnetism dependent on velocity when relativity says that physics should be independent of the reference frame?
              Why is the addition of angular momentum so complicated and how is it "finding the irreducible inequivalent representations of the SO(3) group? Why exactly do Taylor series converge to non-polynomial functions?
              I took these important claims during my studies for granted, but did not actually understand the answers to them until later in my graduate studies. I told myself that when I was more knowledgeable in physics, I would create something to answer these questions I had, and which I am sure
              many physics undergraduates still grapple with today. Langcos is the result of that desire. I hope that Langcos can help everyone answer the questions that I couldn't find the answer to in my undergraduate years.
